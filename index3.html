    <p class="lead text-center" p-4>Why did we chose for this design</p>
 </div>  
</div>

<div class="container p-4">
<p class="lead text-center" p-4>We mainly chose the colours bright green and blue because they stand out and immediately catch the users eye. It is happy and strong, yet the combination of those 2 colours is not a too overwhelming sight. Fun and matching at the same time.
We worked on keeping everything on the website as consistent as possible, we kept the same layout and colours throughout the whole website. The navbar and header are kept the same as well. Varela Round is the chosen font for the overall website. This font is easy to read while looking stylish and young, this also is read throughout the entire website. For the titles we chose to use the font we use for our brand name, Permanent marker. The navbar is obviously at the top where it can be easily found and easily read. Additionally, the contact and Instagram button are big enough to be easily spotted. For the dropdown menu we chose to use it to sell tickets and provide information. In the menu the tickets for the festival, camping, merchandise, lockers and parking can be found. Furthermore, the header is made extra outstanding by the green colour we use in the logo as well as the picture background of the header.
The background chosen for the whole website is one of a festival where there is a heart made with hands. Showing that we want love, respect, harmony and uniformity at the festival.</p>
    <p class="lead text-center" p-4>The pictures we chose are providing a feel and visualisation of who we are and where we stand for. We want to be engaging, social and fun. We want potential customers to know what it is that we do and what those customers can expect of us and our events. We wanted to convey a professional look, but it should not look too serious, boring or bland. That is why there are several pictures of what the festival should look like and images of our target group having fun, having a drink and having an amazing time in the crowd with al like-minded individuals. We made sure that the pictures match our buttons on the front page as well. Under the sub-header “who are we”, we chose to add a picture of fists that represent teamwork. At the sub-header “our events”, there is a picture of a festival that shows what our events look like. The sub-header “tickets” obviously has a sign of a ticket sale added to it. The contact sub-header has a picture of young adults at a festival on their phones smiling, this conveys fun and easily accessible contact with our company. The sub-header “pictures” leads the website user to a page on which there is a carousel on which there are a number of amazing pictures that give a great impression on what we are all about. the picture is a crowd having fun, it matches the other pictures when you click on that button. For the sub-header “our mission” we chose a relatively general picture of our target group at a festival having fun. </p>
    <p class="lead text-center" p-4>Our contact page is a simple yet really helpful page. It is easy to add your name and email and send a message, question or suggestion. 
The pictures we chose to put in our carrousel under the pictures button are pictures that show popular events just like ours. We want our (potential) customers to know what kind of event, atmosphere and people they can expect when attending our festivals. The pictures are supposed to depict fun, power, unity among people, one enormous family having fun.</p>
